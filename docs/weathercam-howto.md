## End-to-end HOWTO for Creating a Weathercam with OnImage()

The `README.md` in the repository mentions that OnImage() is only one component
of several pieces required to have a fully operating "weathercam" web page/site.

This document will detail all the steps required and point to existing content or
contributed content within this repository that you can add alongside the `onimage`
daemon to have a fully-functioning solution.

This HOWTO is based on the specific architecure and components used to run
[kwcam.live](https://kwcam.live).
